# Rook Host Cluster

<!-- <KFD-DOCS> -->

Rook Host Cluster deploys a Ceph [host storage cluster](https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.10/CRDs/Cluster/host-cluster/) using Rook CRs as defined by [Rook Operator](../rook-operator).

The reference architecture implemented by this module is one with a dedicated node pool with directly attached storage provisioned by a human operator, as summarised in the following diagram:
