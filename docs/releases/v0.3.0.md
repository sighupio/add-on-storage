# Storage Add-On Module Release 0.3.0

Welcome to the latest release of the `storage` add-on module for the [`SIGHUP Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/distribution),
maintained by team SIGHUP.

This release includes a new version of Rook Operator. Based on its version constraints,
the minimum supported Kubernetes version is `v1.26.x`.

## Notable Changes ⚠️

Cheph filesystem is now configured with `preserveFilesystemOnDelete: true`, meaning
the filesystem will remain when the CephFilesystem resource is deleted. This is
a security measure to avoid loss of data if the CephFilesystem resource is deleted
accidentally.

To permanently delete a volume using ceph filesystem set `preserveFilesystemOnDelete: false`
then delete the volume.
